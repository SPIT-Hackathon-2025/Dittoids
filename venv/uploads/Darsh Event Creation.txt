### **Transcript:**

**John Smith (CEO):** Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today’s meeting. We have a packed agenda, so let’s get started. First, Sarah will walk us through the marketing strategy for the upcoming quarter. Sarah, over to you.

**Sarah Johnson (Marketing Manager):** Thanks, John. As we move into Q2, our focus will be on expanding our digital ad reach and launching a new social media campaign. We plan to increase engagement by 25% through targeted content. We’re also exploring influencer partnerships.

**John Smith (CEO):** That sounds promising. Michael, how does this align with our product roadmap?

**Michael Lee (Product Manager):** We’re currently finalizing the next product update, which will roll out in April. The marketing team’s efforts will be crucial in driving awareness and adoption. We need to ensure messaging highlights the new features effectively.

**Sarah Johnson (Marketing Manager):** Absolutely, we’ll coordinate closely with your team to align content and release schedules.

**John Smith (CEO):** Great. David, let’s talk budget. What’s the allocation for marketing this quarter?

**David Brown (Finance):** We have allocated an additional 10% increase for digital marketing, given its strong ROI last quarter. However, we need to monitor spending and adjust as necessary.

**John Smith (CEO):** Understood. Emily, do we have any HR updates?

**Emily Davis (HR):** Yes, we’re launching a new employee wellness program next month, which includes mental health support and fitness incentives. Also, we have three new hires starting next week.

**John Smith (CEO):** That’s great to hear. If there are no further questions, we’ll wrap up. Thanks, everyone, for your time and contributions. Let’s execute on these plans and follow up in our next meeting. Have a great day!
